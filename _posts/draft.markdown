NOTE: This is not ready to publish, just as I talk or think about games I'm trying to make notes and stuff.

Yeah, I think my core beef with progression-based roguelikes is the sort of prolonged tutorial effect of getting to the point where it's even mechanically possible to get anywhere in the game. Thus far I haven't really felt like I'm grinding for the sake of grinding, the pace has been really good. I've been making intentional choices at the doors to focus on Dark or Gemstones or Keys at various times but for the most part there's a good enough mix that when I want to get something it's usually only a run or two away
